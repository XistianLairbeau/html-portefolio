    <p>This page is set up to showcase my work as a web developer. Everything is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. I also showcase some of my photography and some of my music. I can provide services in development, SEO and web design if you need help setting up a website. I use my experience from journalism to tailor a website to your needs. I can also write and maintain a blog for websites to improve the search engine ranking your site has in the most popular search engines.</p>

    <h2><a href="./public/about.html">About me</a></h2>
    <p>I'm a certified media and music nerd with a degree in media science and music science from the University of Oslo. Among my favorite subjects are journalism, photography, music and digital media. I have my own studio where I develop photographic art, produce my own music, and make digital media like websites and social media content. </p>

<p>For a living I work as an interviewer for an organisation that makes official statistics. I gather data for analysis and interview people about various subjects, like work situation, quality of life, media consumption, travel habits and so on. I enjoy my work and learn a lot of interesting  things about the general public in the country I live in.</p>

<p>I also do side gigs as a photographer and music producer. I've photographed weddings, social events, festivals and political parties. As a producer I have released meditation music on Spotify(Lairbeau) and have made tailor made music for performance artists in genres such as house music and alternative music.</p>

    <p><h2><a href="./public/movie-ranking.html">The Best Movies According to Christian</a></h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
        <hr />
        <h4>Kill Bill</h4>
        <p>A really high-paced and intense Kung-Fu/Western inspired movie. It follows a world-class assasin, seeking revenge on a treachorous gang of colleagues. In my opinion this is Quentin Tarantino at his best.</p>
        <h4>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.</h4> <p>Based on a litterary masterpiece by J.R.R. Tolkien, the movies are Peter Jacksons' cinematic masterpiece. The movies stay incredibly true to the books for the most part and the cast is incredible.</h4>
        </p>
        <h4>The Matrix</h4>
        <p>The original Matrix movie is an Action/Sci-Fi movie that manages to tell an enticing story with lots of action as well as deep philosophical themes weaved into the plot. Perhaps the most action-filled introduction to philosophy there is.</p>
